## History

This was inspired by Community, [S05E08](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Development_and_Condiments)

The app was built in a few days after the episode aired and released on the app store. It survived there for a month or two before Apple decided it could be used to encourage online bullying. That offered for me to remove the "rating other people" feature, but I figured that was basically all the app ever did, so I pulled it.

And now I release it to all you twos. Make of it what you will.

yooba dooba dooba,
Will

## Notes

- Built in a few days, so it's messy
- Haven't tested this in a year, so probably broken
